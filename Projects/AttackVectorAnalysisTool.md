# Attack Vector Analysis Tool

An interactive security vulnerability assessment interface that maps relationships between common attack vectors, showing prerequisites, potential consequences, and risk levels for each attack type.

## Overview

This tool provides an interactive visualization of various attack vectors, helping security professionals and students understand:

- How different attack types relate to each other
- Which vulnerabilities can lead to other exploits
- Risk levels and severity of different attacks
- Common attack patterns and chains

## Features

### Risk Assessment
{: .no_toc }

- Visual risk level indicators (Medium to Critical)
- Numerical risk scores (5/10 - 10/10)
- Terminal indicators for command-line based attacks
- Filterable view by risk level

### Attack Vector Mapping
