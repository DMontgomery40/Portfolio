# Attack Vector Analysis Tool

An interactive security vulnerability assessment interface that maps relationships between common attack vectors, showing prerequisites, potential consequences, and risk levels for each attack type.

## Overview

This tool provides an interactive visualization of various attack vectors, helping security professionals and students understand:
- How different attack types relate to each other
- Which vulnerabilities can lead to other exploits
- Risk levels and severity of different attacks
- Common attack patterns and chains

## Features

### Risk Assessment
- Visual risk level indicators (Medium to Critical)
- Numerical risk scores (5/10 - 10/10)
- Terminal indicators for command-line based attacks
- Filterable view by risk level

### Attack Vector Mapping
- Target information (e.g., Login Form, Database, User Sessions)
- Common aliases and related techniques
- Risk level and severity score
- Prerequisites ("Caused By")

### Interactive Navigation


- Click-through relationship exploration
- Follow attack chains from initial breach to potential escalations
- Filter by risk level or attack type
- Detailed view for each attack vector

### Attack Types Covered


- Authentication attacks (Brute Force, Password Spraying)
- Data extraction (SQL Injection)
- Social attacks (Phishing, Social Engineering)
- Session attacks (Hijacking, Cookie Theft)
- System attacks (Zero-Day Exploits)
- Network attacks (Man-in-the-Middle, DNS Cache Poisoning)
- Client-side attacks (XSS, Keylogging)
- Physical security (Physical Security Breach)
- Cryptographic attacks (Rainbow Table Attack)

## Technical Implementation
