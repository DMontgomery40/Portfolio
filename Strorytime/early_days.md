# Early Days

I've always had that hacker mindset, starting with a subscription to 2600 - my monthly window into the fascinating world of phone phreaking and early computer security. Like many before me, I tried my hand at the classic quarter-on-a-fishing-line payphone hack. There was something captivating about understanding how systems worked and finding creative ways to interact with them.

I even managed to catch the tail end of the Blue Box keytones era, just before they patched that exploit. While I was a bit late to that particular party (story of my life - I probably would have been the guy showing up to the Homebrew Computer Club right after the Apple II launched), it gave me a taste for exploring technology's boundaries. But my real journey into modern technology, particularly AI and security, started with something much more mundane: a light switch.
