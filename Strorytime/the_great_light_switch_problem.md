We moved into a new house right after GPT-3's release, and there was this maddening design flaw: you had to walk all the way across the kitchen to turn on the lights. No switch by the entrance - who designs these things? It drove me absolutely insane. I'd always been curious about Raspberry Pis but never made the time to really dive in. This light switch problem changed that.

The solution started with Homebridge, which led to my first Pi, which turned into my first real deep dive into the Linux filesystem. Sure, I had command line experience, and I'd done my share of Excel and VBA work professionally. But there was something about the Linux philosophy - everything is a file, the elegant simplicity, the raw speed - that completely captivated me.
