# Accidental Enterprise AI

Around the same time frame, we started integrating an LLM into our home-built CRM at my agency and I started working with the IT team much more closely. I did a lot of work helping them fine-tune LLAMA, I forget which LLAMA model it was, one of the early ones, probably the 3B size. 

At the time, OpenAI didn't have their graphical interface for fine-tuning. I don't think Hugging Face even had one either, or I didn't know about it. So, it was a lot of manually, or at least semi-manually, taking problem resolution from IT support ticket emails, and turning that into JSONL embeddings and then creating a RAG. I think we used Pinecone initially and then moved on to Redis. 

My time working on the language model fine-tuning gave me such an incredibly strong appreciation for what we have now in terms of technology and ease of use.
