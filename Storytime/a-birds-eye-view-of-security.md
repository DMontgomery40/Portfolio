# A Potential Image Classification Approach to Historical Behavioral Analysis 

A thought that hit me while working on this write up for Ghost: in my birdnet project experience, we're dealing with these incredibly complex audio waveforms, converting them into simple 2D spectrograms, and then using super efficient CNN-based image classification to identify species. We're not analyzing the sound at all - we're just looking at shapes and patterns.

It made me wonder about behavioral analysis in security, particularly when trying to spot the most sophisticated attackers - the ones who are incredibly patient and whose patterns only emerge over very long time periods. Currently, analyzing years of raw behavioral data - login patterns, API calls, network traffic - in its native form requires massive computational resources. But what if there was a way to apply a similar pattern recognition approach?

The idea would be converting years of behavioral data into standardized 2D visual representations - essentially "behavioral spectrograms." Your X axis would be time (months or years), your Y axis could be different types of actions or locations, and color intensity could represent frequency or risk scores. This would create a literal picture of long-term behavior patterns that might reveal what we're missing when we look at shorter timeframes.

Then, instead of running complex behavioral analysis algorithms on massive datasets, a CNN could be trained to recognize patterns in these images. But here's where it gets interesting - by leveraging agentic AI, you could have agents continuously identifying confirmed incidents and their resolutions, automatically generating training data by converting those years-long attack patterns into these visual representations. The model would get exponentially better at recognizing these subtle, long-term patterns - the kind that might indicate a careful, patient operator who's playing the long game.

The computational efficiency could be remarkable. Just like how a small Pi can run bird call classification locally because it's just doing lightweight image processing, this could potentially allow for efficient analysis of massive historical datasets. And since it would be looking for visual patterns rather than specific behaviors, it might help identify those subtle, years-long patterns that even experienced analysts might miss when looking at shorter time windows. 

I can see the validity of this response: "so, compression..." But it's really more like: 

```Data Recontextualization Through Geometric Perspective Transformation. DaRT GPT. ``` 

(I want the last 45 minutes of my life back, that's how long that name / accronym took me)

I'm sure there are many challenges and limitations to this approach that I haven't considered, but seeing how effectively static image classification works in other domains made me wonder about its potential applications in security, especially for catching those most patient and sophisticated attackers. Would be very interested in learning whether similar approaches have been explored in the field (or maybe you've already essentially been doing this for all I know).

## Update: 1/1/2025

After sleeping on what was essentially a stream of consciousness brainstorm, more challenges have come to mind, in regard to the actual implementation.  

  - What is the computational expense of transforming that data into a 2D image, and what are the actual net savings?
    - I think after growing pains this could be overcome
  - I'm picturing pitching this feature to potential client: 
    - "We are now shipping a new feature that essentially plans on us missing potential threats for many months or years at a time"
    - Easy to spin that a different way but made me chuckle

### Other edits, thoughts, and additions: 

  - One potential extension worth exploring would be multi-channel encoding, similar to how RGB images encode different layers of information. Rather than flattening behavioral metrics into a single-channel representation, we could create multi-dimensional behavioral signatures where each channel captures distinct activity patterns. This could allow the CNN to detect correlations between channels that might be obscured in a single-layer approach.

  - The application of wavelet transform concepts to these behavioral spectrograms could offer additional insight. By analyzing behavior across multiple temporal resolutions simultaneously, this approach could potentially identify both rapid automated attacks and long-term patterns that emerge over months of patient operation. This multi-scale analysis might help bridge the gap between traditional real-time detection and long-term behavioral analysis.
     - I am not a mathmetiician, and I'm not capable of implementing this; nevertheless, from the little I know, it seems to a logical addition. 

  - A key enhancement to consider would be entropy-weighted encoding. Given that sophisticated attackers excel at mimicking normal behavior patterns, an encoding scheme that emphasizes rare or high-entropy events could be valuable. By adjusting the visual weighting based on statistical probability, the model could become more sensitive to subtle deviations while maintaining the computational efficiency of CNN-based pattern recognition.
     - I'm not ignorant to the contradiction here: how do put a weight on that before seeing it... chicken / egg sitation, maybe the Agentic stuff can figure it at some stage, just thought it was worth mentioning
