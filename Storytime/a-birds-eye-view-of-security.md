# A Potential Image Classification Approach to Historical Behavioral Analysis 

A thought that hit me while working on this write up for Ghost: in my birdnet project experience, we're dealing with these incredibly complex audio waveforms, converting them into simple 2D spectrograms, and then using super efficient CNN-based image classification to identify species. We're not analyzing the sound at all - we're just looking at shapes and patterns.

It made me wonder about behavioral analysis in security, particularly when trying to spot the most sophisticated attackers - the ones who are incredibly patient and whose patterns only emerge over very long time periods. Currently, analyzing years of raw behavioral data - login patterns, API calls, network traffic - in its native form requires massive computational resources. But what if there was a way to apply a similar pattern recognition approach?

The idea would be converting years of behavioral data into standardized 2D visual representations - essentially "behavioral spectrograms." Your X axis would be time (months or years), your Y axis could be different types of actions or locations, and color intensity could represent frequency or risk scores. This would create a literal picture of long-term behavior patterns that might reveal what we're missing when we look at shorter timeframes.

One impoprtant difference between an actual spectrogram of a sound, and this specific application, is the amount of resolution needed, which is why 4k QR codes would be a perfect use case for this application. They can store a relatively massive amount of data in a visual format that multi-modal machine learning works well with. 

Then, instead of running complex behavioral analysis algorithms on massive datasets, a CNN could be trained to recognize patterns in these images. But here's where it gets interesting - by leveraging agentic AI, you could have agents continuously identifying confirmed incidents and their resolutions, automatically generating training data by converting those years-long attack patterns into these visual representations. The model would get exponentially better at recognizing these subtle, long-term patterns - the kind that might indicate a careful, patient operator who's playing the long game.

The computational efficiency could be remarkable. Just like how a small Pi can run bird call classification locally because it's just doing lightweight image processing, this could potentially allow for efficient analysis of massive historical datasets. And since it would be looking for visual patterns rather than specific behaviors, it might help identify those subtle, years-long patterns that even experienced analysts might miss when looking at shorter time windows.

I'm sure there are many challenges and limitations to this approach that I haven't considered, but seeing how effectively static image classification works in other domains made me wonder about its potential applications in security, especially for catching those most patient and sophisticated attackers. Would be very interested in learning whether similar approaches have been explored in the field (or maybe you've already essentially been doing this for all I know).

## _And in the spriit of "why not" -- Here's o1 Pro's rewrite and overview_

### Proposal Memo: Leveraging Image-Based Pattern Recognition for Long-Term Behavioral Analysis

**Overview**

In fields like bird call identification, we’ve seen impressive results by converting complex audio waveforms into 2D spectrograms and then applying CNN-based image classification. This technique trades direct audio analysis for pattern recognition in what amounts to “pictures” of the sound, enabling fast and accurate identification on relatively modest hardware.

**Applying This to Security**

A parallel strategy could be used for detecting long-term, sophisticated cyberattacks. Instead of crunching raw logs over years—logins, network traffic, API calls, etc.—we could transform them into standardized 2D images, effectively creating “behavioral spectrograms.” With the right encoding, patterns that unfold over months or years might visually pop out, even if they’re missed by traditional detection methods looking only at shorter time spans.

**Why High-Resolution QR Codes?**

A core challenge is the balance between capturing years of data and retaining enough granularity to detect subtle anomalies. High-resolution QR codes offer a potential solution. QR codes are designed to encode large amounts of information into a relatively compact 2D image. This helps address the problem of losing important details when compressing massive datasets into a smaller visual footprint. By embedding key contextual or metadata elements into these codes—alongside time-sequenced data points—your CNN-based models can preserve more relevant detail while still benefiting from a standard 2D image format.

1. **Compression Without Extreme Fidelity Loss**  

   - QR codes can hold substantial data. Designing a custom high-res QR code “template” could store multiple dimensions (e.g., time ranges, event types, risk scores) without collapsing the data so far that critical anomalies disappear.

2. **Automated Training Data Generation**  

   - Agentic AI can continuously label confirmed security incidents, convert them into these high-resolution QR-coded “behavioral images,” and feed them back into training. Over time, the model grows more adept at spotting the low-and-slow threats.

3. **Computational Efficiency**  

   - Once the raw data is converted to image form (QR codes or other structured images), classification tasks can be done with lightweight CNNs. The approach scales well and can even run on edge-like devices.

4. **Potential Challenges**  

   - **Standardization**: Defining a universal QR format or template across varied organizations’ data might be tricky.  
   - **Labeling Accuracy**: If threat labels are incorrect or incomplete, the CNN might learn flawed patterns.  
   - **Interpretability**: CNNs excel at classification but can be black-box. Post-detection forensics will still require diving into raw logs to confirm the root cause.

## Conclusion

Visualizing multi-year logs as high-resolution QR codes could be a powerful way to spot subtle anomalies that typical time-series analyses miss. We’d get a “big picture” overview with enough detail to train robust CNN models. Over time, the system’s performance would improve as more labeled incidents are introduced.
