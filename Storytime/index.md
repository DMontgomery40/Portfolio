# My Journey into AI 
From phone phreaking to bird watching, with a whole lot of Linux, machine learning, and security in between.

# TL;DR

A former phone phreaker's journey into modern tech, sparked by a poorly placed kitchen light switch. What started as a simple home automation project with a Raspberry Pi evolved into a deep dive into Linux, AI, and machine learning. The pandemic led to an unexpected intersection of bird watching and technology, resulting in multiple AI projects:

- A local bird sound identification system using CNN-based spectrogram analysis
- Custom computer vision models for identifying bird species from camera feeds
- Enterprise-level LLM integration for CRM systems
- Implementation of self-driving car technology

The story showcases how practical problems and personal interests can drive technical learning, from basic home automation to sophisticated AI applications. Each project built upon the last, combining open-source technologies, hardware hacking, and AI implementations in increasingly complex ways.

Key themes include:
- The transition from traditional hacking to modern tech exploration
- The practical applications of AI in everyday scenarios
- The importance of hands-on learning through real projects
- The convergence of multiple technical disciplines in modern AI implementations
