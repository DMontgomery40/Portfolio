We moved into a new house right after GPT-3's release, and there was this maddening design flaw: you had to walk all the way across the kitchen to turn on the lights. No switch by the entrance - It drove me absolutely insane. I'd always been curious about Raspberry Pis but never made the time to really dive in. This light switch problem finally pushed me over the edge.

The solution started with Homebridge, which led to my first Pi. What began as a simple home automation project turned into my first real deep dive into the Linux filesystem. Sure, I had command line experience, and I'd done my share of VBA in Excel professionally. But there was something about the Linux philosophy - everything is a file, the elegant simplicity, the raw speed - that completely captivated me.

This project was my gateway drug into modern home automation and, eventually, AI. It taught me the value of starting small but thinking big. A simple light switch problem led to a complete homelab, which would later become the foundation for my AI experiments.
