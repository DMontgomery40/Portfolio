# The Great Light Switch Problem

We moved into a new house right after GPT-3 came out. And then there was a huge problem. For some reason, whoever wired this house decided that it was a good idea to walk all the way across the kitchen before you're able to turn the light on in the kitchen, as opposed to just having a light switch right there when you walked into the kitchen. Drove me absolutely insane. 

I'd always had an interest in Raspberry Pis, but never had the time to learn and teach myself. But that light switch led to a Homebridge solution, which led to my first Pi, which led to my first experience, or prolonged experience at least, with the Linux file system. I had already had command line experience like any good nerd would, and had used Excel and VBAs extensively through my professional career, but there's something about the Linux command line and file system in general that I fell in love with. The whole "everything is a file" thing, the simplicity, the freedom, and the raw speed of it.
