# Self Driving Side Quest

Unrelated to birds, or work, is OpenPilot, aka Comma.ai, aka turning my RAV4 into a level 2 driving assistance, or more popularly known by the misnomer of "self-driving" car. I probably wouldn't have ever known about this project if it wasn't by George Hotz, who I've greatly admired for many years for obvious reasons. I discovered it after one of his appearances on Lex Friedman. 

I didn't really know that I needed a partly self-driving car, but it was George Hotz. I mean I probably would have bought it even if I didn't own a car. I love diving into the back end of that project because it is at the intersection of so many pieces of interest for me. It has the object detection and image classification, a language model component, and given the fact that it's controlling a flying deathtrap, there's a serious security component to it as well, particularly since it has an active SIM card, Bluetooth, WiFi, and SSH access. There is no wiggle room for latency with OpenPilot, and it's running everything locally on a SnapDragon 845. 

Exploring the cavernous OpenPilot GitHub has been a fun adventure as has following that Discord, particularly the dev Discord. "Geohot" is now more focused full-time on his tinygrad/tinybox project. So, of course, now I need to buy a tinybox. I mean it's only $40k -- how could you afford _not_ to?
