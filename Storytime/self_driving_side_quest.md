# Self Driving Side Quest

Unrelated to birds, or work, or cyber security is OpenPilot, aka Comma.ai, aka turning my RAV4 into a level 2 driving assistance, or more popularly known by the misnomer of "self-driving" car. I probably wouldn't have ever known about this project if it wasn't by George Hotz, who I've greatly admired for many years for obvious reasons. I discovered it after one of his appearances on Lex Friedman. 

I didn't really know that I needed a partly self-driving car, but it was George Hotz. I mean I probably would have bought it even if I didn't own a car. I really loved diving into the back end of that project because it is at the intersection of so many pieces of interest for me. It had the object detection image classification, had a language model component, and obviously given the fact that it's controlling a flying deathtrap, there's a very very serious security component to it as well, particularly since it does connect and talk to the internet if you want the navigation piece, which of course you do. 

So taking a dive into the back end of the OpenPilot GitHub has been a really fun adventure as has following that Discord, particularly the dev Discord. George "Geohot" is now more focused full-time on his tiny grad/tiny box project. So of course now I need to buy a tiny box. I mean it's only 40 grand so really how could you afford not to lol.
