# Self Driving Side Quest

So taking a dive into the back end of the OpenPilot GitHub has been a really fun adventure as has following that Discord, particularly the dev Discord. George "Geohot" is now more focused full-time on his tiny grad/tiny box project. So of course now I need to buy a tiny box. I mean it's only 40 grand so really how could you afford not to lol.
