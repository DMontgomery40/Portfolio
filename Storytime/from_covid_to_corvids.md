# From COVID to Corvids

During the pandemic, with a newborn keeping me homebound, I discovered an unexpected passion: birds. Being stuck at home meant spending a lot of time looking out windows, and I started noticing the fascinating world of songbirds right in my backyard. This wasn't just casual bird watching - it became a full-blown technical obsession that would merge perfectly with my growing interest in AI.

After getting my first Pi set up with Homebridge, I discovered Pi-Hole, HA, pfSense, and moved all that to a Mini-PC. The revelation that I could block ads network-wide for free was mind-blowing enough, but it also meant I had an extra Pi lying around. That's when I stumbled upon the BirdNet-Pi project on GitHub, and everything changed.

The project immediately captivated me because it represented everything I loved: open source software, practical AI applications, and an excuse to buy more hardware. Plus, it was a perfect example of how AI could enhance real-world hobbies in unexpected ways.
