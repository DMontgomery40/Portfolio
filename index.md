## About

This portfolio demonstrates my focus on:
- Security analysis and tools
- birbs üê¶
- System utilities and monitoring
- API integrations and data processing
- Educational technology (birbs üê•) 

The featured projects highlight my interests in building practical tools and backend systems. And in full disclosure, building off a Jekyll Template highlights the peak of my frontend skills as well.
