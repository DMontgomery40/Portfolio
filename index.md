# Project Portfolio

> **Note**: This portfolio represents a random sampling of various development projects. While these projects showcase different technical capabilities, they're primarily focused on backend development, security tools, and system utilities rather than frontend development.  
>
> And in full disclosure, building off a Jekyll Template highlights the peak of my frontend skills.

## Storytime

## Featured Projects

### [Intel NPU Monitoring Tool](./Projects/intel-npu-top.html)

>*Just 52 lines of pure Python. No dependencies. No complications. It just works.*
